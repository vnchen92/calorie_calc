## Background

Know how much you are eating at Subway if you are calorie conscious or macro conscious. Choose from custom options to menu items and see how much protein, carbs, and fat you are consuming. Feel free to update/edit your options and your macros and calorie count will also update as you go. 


## Functionality & MVPs

Users will be able to:
- Choose menu items and customize their meal
- Adjust, edit, and clear meal options
- View what they have currently selected, the current calorie total compared to the amount of protein, carbs, and fat, as they choose their options
- Compare what they have currently selected to the U.S Dietary Guidelines for Americans


## Wire Frames

- Footer will include links to this project's Github repo and my LinkedIn.
- Left will contain all customizable items 
- Right will contain bar chart showing total calories and macros as each option is selected.


## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
- Nutritional information from Subway (public)
- Chart.js to animate the bar chart
- A splash of Vanilla DOM
- Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
- npm to manage project dependences


## Imprementation Timeline

- Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Set up project, including getting webpack up and running. Convert Subway PDF nutrional information to accessable data. Set up backend if needed. Make sure data converted is fully operattional. Start implementing logic needed to calculate calories based on preferences chosen.

- Monday: Build out basic HTML structure. Learn more about Chart.js. Start implementing bar chart with Chart.js. Start implementing methods to update the chart as options are entered.

- Tuesday: Make sure everything is being rendered properly before moving on. Focus on styling with CSS. Switch back and forth between javascript and CSS.

- Wednesday: Finish styling page. Add bonus features if there is time.

- Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages.


## Bonus Features

There are so many ways in which this calculator can be more helpful and customizable. Some updates can be:
- Splash page: implement form for user before displaying everything to check what they would like their maximum calories, carb, protein, and fat intake before to customize the bar chart before it has been rendered.
- Chart comparason between current meal and US recommended guidelines
